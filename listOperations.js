 len: sequence indexing: If u is a sequence, then |u| is the length of u.

 listsub: If s is a list of length n and 1 ≤ i ≤ n, then we may write s[i] for the i'th member of u.
 This operation associates together from the left with tuple indexing; e.g., we may write  s[i][j] for (s[i])[j].

 listeq: if s and t are lists of the same type we may write s = t to mean that s and t are the same list

 cat: If s and t are lists of the same type we may write s + t for the concatenation of s and t.
 For example, <1,2,3> + <4,5,6> = <1,2,3,4,5,6>

 slice: f s is a list and 1 ≤ i, j ≤ |s|, we may write s[i..j] for <si,...,sj>.
 If i > j, the result is the empty list.
